# Awdur

*Previously, Awdur was an attempt at using electron to build a simple UI.
This branch is kept on the off chance someone finds the code here interesting.*

A simple Electron app for writing scripts in the [Fountain][fountain] markup format
based on the [Monaco Editor][monaco-editor] from [VSCode][vscode].

Current goal is to use this project in order to figure out how to develop an Electron
app end-to-end.
